## Abstract
This project is a general study of modern art portraits with a particular interest in the color aspect of the paintings. Quantitative information about the artistic movements, painters and colors have been used to answer some specific research questions. 

This project has been carried out for the exam of Electronic Publishing and Digital Storytelling held by Professor Marilena Daquino, within the [Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/DigitalHumanitiesKnowledge) course at the University of Bologna.

## Goal  
A study on portraits through the modern age and with focus on quantitative information and a color scheme analysis

## Research questions
* What and how many portraits and self portaits can be found in each artistic period? 
* How do colours change through time? (eg: How are the self portraits in impressionism different from expressionists ones?)
